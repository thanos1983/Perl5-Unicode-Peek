=head1 NAME
    Unicode::Peek - Perl module supports different unicode(s) transformation
    formats to hex and vice versa.


=head1 VERSION
    Version 0.01


=head1 SYNOPSIS
    The Unicode::Peek - Perl module provides to the user the ability to encode/
    decode asccii strings in a variety of unicode transformations to hex and vice
    versa. The user is able to take a peek in the hex data and see the formatted
    output and also vise versa. The user can provided an array of data in a hex
    format and convert it back to ascii. Perl version 5.13.2 or greater is required.

    use Unicode::Peek ( 'ascii2hexEncode', 'hex2ascciiDecode',
                        'hexDumperOutput', 'hexDumperInput' );

    my $hexEncoded         = ascii2hexEncode($unicodeFormat, $ascciiCharacters);
    ...

    my $ascciiCharacters   = hex2ascciiDecode($unicodeFormat, $hexEncoded);
    ...

    my @hexFormattedOutput = hexDumperOutput($unicodeFormat, $ascciiCharacters);
    ...

    my $ascciiCharacters   = hexDumperInput($unicodeFormat, \@hexFormattedOutput);
    ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION
    This module exports four methods (ascii2hexEncode, hex2ascciiDecode, hexDumperOutput
    and hexDumperInput). All methods support 14 different encoding and decoding formats.
    The module has been tested with multiple languages with complex characters, but not
    with all known languages in the planet. So far as many languages have been tested all
    characters where encoded / decoded correctly.


=head2 EXPORT
    None by default, but the module can also export all methods by simple declaring all:

    use Unicode::Peek ':all';

=head1 EXAMPLE 1 (hexDumperOutput)
=encoding utf8
    This example is for femonstration purposes, randomly choosen Chinese as a testing
    language. We will use the L<Data::Dumper|https://perldoc.perl.org/Data/Dumper.html> module to print the formated hex output. Necessary is also the L<utf8|https://perldoc.perl.org/utf8.html>
    for the stdout (convert the internal representation of a Perl scalar to/from UTF-8.)

  #!/usr/bin/perl
  use utf8;
  use strict;
  use warnings;
  use Data::Dumper;

  use Unicode::Peek qw( hexDumperOutput );

  my $lanquage = 'Chinese';

  my $str = '這是一個測試';

  my @flags = ( 'UCS-2',
	        'UCS-2BE',
	        'UCS-2LE',
	        'UCS-4',
	        'UTF-7',
	        'utf8',
	        'UTF-8',
	        'utf-8-strict',
	        'UTF-16',
	        'UTF-16BE',

	        'UTF-32',
	        'UTF-32BE',
	        'UTF-32LE' );

  while ( defined ( my $flag = shift @flags ) ) {
      print Dumper hexDumperOutput($flag, $str);
  };

=head1 EXAMPLE 2 (hexDumperInput)

  #!/usr/bin/perl
  use utf8;
  use strict;
  use warnings;
  use Data::Dumper;
  use feature 'say';

  use Unicode::Peek qw( hexDumperOutput hexDumperInput );

	        'UCS-2LE',
	        'UCS-4',
	        'UTF-7',
	        'utf8',
	        'UTF-8',
	        'utf-8-strict',
	        'UTF-16',
	        'UTF-16BE',
	        'UTF-16LE',
	        'UTF-32',
	        'UTF-32BE',
	        'UTF-32LE' );

  while ( defined ( my $flag = shift @flags ) ) {
      my $hexDumper = hexDumperOutput($flag, $str);
      print Dumper $hexDumper;
      say hexDumperInput($flag, $hexDumper);
  };


=head1 EXAMPLE 3 (hex2ascciiDecode ascii2hexEncode)

  #!/usr/bin/perl
  use utf8;
  use strict;
  use warnings;
  use feature 'say';

  use Unicode::Peek qw( hex2ascciiDecode ascii2hexEncode );

  my $lanquage = 'Chinese';

  my $str = '這是一個測試';

  my @flags = ( 'UCS-2',
	        'UCS-2BE',
	        'UCS-2LE',
	        'UCS-4',
	        'UTF-7',
	        'utf8',
	        'UTF-8',
	        'utf-8-strict',
	        'UTF-16',
	        'UTF-16BE',
	        'UTF-16LE',
	        'UTF-32',
	        'UTF-32BE',
	        'UTF-32LE' );

  while ( defined ( my $flag = shift @flags ) ) {
      my $hexEncoded = ascii2hexEncode($flag, $str);
      say hex2ascciiDecode($flag, $hexEncoded);
  };


DEPENDENCIES
    The module is implemented by using 'utf8' and 'Encode', both modules are
    mandatory as prerequisites and required to be pre-installed.
